PYTHON PROJECT--

GUESS WORD GAME
-Objective: In game, we declare the word and then let the user guess that word letter by 
letter.
-It also limits the number of times the user can guess a letter, so it sets limits on the number 
of guesses.


MACHINE LEARNING PROJECTS--

INCOMING MAIL DETECTION
-Objective: It predicts whether the given mail is Ham (Authenticate) Mail or Spam (Fraud) 
Mail.
-It is done by using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) Algorithm for the Classification 
Technique
to create the best line that can segregate n-dimensional space into classes. 

BREAST CANCER DETECTION
-Objective: Predicting whether the breast cancer is in the Benign stage or in the Malignant 
stage.
-This is done by using the Logistic Regression Algorithm which is used for the Binary 
Classification Technique.

WEATHER PREDICTION
-Objective: Predicting on basis of the weather conditions data, that is the weather is suitable 
to go outside or not.
-This is done by using the Gaussian form of Naive Bayes Algorithm which is here is used for 
the Classification Technique
