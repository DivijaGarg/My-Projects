So at first may be user guesses letter'e',we say yes it is present in word,then may be he guess letter 'f',we say no its not there.And we also limit the no of times he can guess letter lets say we set limit on the no of guesses upto 12 letters,so we keep on notifying user that he has 12 turns left,then 11 turns, then 10 and so on.\n",
